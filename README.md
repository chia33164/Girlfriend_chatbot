Template Code for TOC Project 2019

A Facebook messenger bot based on a finite state machine

More details in the [Slides](https://hackmd.io/p/SkpBR-Yam#/) and [FAQ](https://hackmd.io/s/B1Xw7E8kN)

## Setup

### Prerequisite
* Python 3
* Facebook Page and App
* HTTPS Server

#### Install Dependency
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

* pygraphviz (For visualizing Finite State Machine)
    * [Setup pygraphviz on Ubuntu](http://www.jianshu.com/p/a3da7ecc5303)

#### Secret Data

`VERIFY_TOKEN` and `ACCESS_TOKEN` **MUST** be set to proper values.
Otherwise, you might not be able to run your code.

#### Run Locally
You can either setup https server or using `ngrok` as a proxy.

**`ngrok` would be used in the following instruction**

```sh
./ngrok http 5000
```

After that, `ngrok` would generate a https URL.

#### Run the sever

```sh
python3 app.py
```

## Finite State Machine

## Usage
The initial state is set to `user`.

Every time `user` state is triggered to `advance` to another state, it will `go_back` to `user` state after the bot replies corresponding message.

* user
	* Input: "go to state1"
		* Reply: "I'm entering state1"

	* Input: "go to state2"
		* Reply: "I'm entering state2"
